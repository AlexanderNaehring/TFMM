<h2>The History of TFMM</h2>
<p>
  TFMM was developed during the BETA phase of Train Fever in 2014.
  During the beta and until early 2015, there was no possibility to install mods natively in Train Fever.
  However, as Train Fever uses a very open and modding friendly storage format, mods could easily be imported to the game.
  They simply had to be installed by placing all required files directly beneath the original <em>vanilla</em> files.
  Their placement however made removing mods unnecessarily complicated and tedious.
  <br />
  TFMM helped the users to easily install mods with a simple Drag&amp;Drop action.
  Also, deactivating and removing mods was only a matter of a single click.
  All information about the mod, including preview images and information about the author,
  were displayed in a clear way and even batch-editing a great amount of mods was made possible.
</p>
<p>
  With the introduction of the <em>new modding system</em> in early 2015, mods can now be placed in a distinct <kbd>mods/</kbd> folder.
  This makes adding and removing mods without the help of a software like TFMM much more easier.
  However, with this introduction the capability of mod managers to automatically enable a mod across all save games was removed.
  Also, the internal mod manager in the game has very limited usability and clarity.
  <br />
  The players have to select all mods they want to use prior to creating a game; the list of mods used the last time is saved.
  While in the past TFMM could activate and deactivate mods across all individual save games, these now remember the list of used mods separately.
  Adding and removing mods has to be done by the player individually for each single save file inside the game.
  <br />
  While it is still possible to install mods using the <em>old</em> system of placing them beneath the game data,
  this could lead to problems when new patches are distributed.
  Also, this method is neither recommended nor supported by the developers.
</p>
<p>
  Since TFMM in is original form has limited use after the mod system update,
  TFMM now focuses on directly bringing the vast amount of mods made available by the community to your desktop.
  TFMM can access the database of <a href='http://www.train-fever.net'>Train-Fever.net</a> with over 1,000 mods.
  The program also aims to give you as much information and control about the mods installed in your game as possible.
</p>
<p>
  As of July 2015, TFMM is still under development but save to use. Stay tuned for further updates.
