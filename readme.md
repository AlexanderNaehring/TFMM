Train Fever Mod Manager (TFMM)
====

_TFMM_ aims to help the player organize and keep track of modifications installed for Train Fever, a transportation simulation game developed by Urban Games.

_TFMM_ is written in PureBasic which can be compiled to Windows, Mac and Linux. Since Train Fever (Beta) is only available for Windows, _TFMM_ also only offers compiled binaries for Windows x86.
