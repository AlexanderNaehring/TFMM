----

__Train Fever Mod Manager (TFMM)__ aims to help the player organize and keep track of modifications installed for Train Fever, a transportation simulation game developed by Urban Games.

__TFMM__ is written in PureBasic which can be compiled to Windows, Mac and Linux. Since Train Fever (Beta) is only available for Windows, __TFMM__ also only offers compiled binaries for Windows x86.
